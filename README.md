The joker bot is a joke randomizer. The user puts in yes or no. If the user selects yes, the joker bot will return a randomized choice of jokes from the array. Then the user has an option to say yes again and the bot will return yet another joke. the user can also say no, and the bot will ask if you are sure, you can choose yes or no, and the cycle will continue. If the user enters done, the program will end.
